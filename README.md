# CreativeMaking-LegendOfHanzi-UnitingThePastAndPresent

## My Mission of the Project
- 4 backgrounds: Game Cover, Background of 2 game levels, game endings background
- GIF sequences of Hanzi translation animation

## What I would like to learn from this project
I worked as an illustrator before and is running my own brand. Usually one painting will take 3-5 working days, preprocesses including doing research, drawing draft, composition, create color schemes. After all these preparation then I can finally start drawing. I'm thinking in which step could be helped by AI so I started the research:

## AI helping in specific part of drawing
### Huemint:
https://huemint.com/upload/
Huemint is a colour palette generator. The app uses machine learning to create unique colour combinations for your brand, website, or graphics.
### Fontjoy:
https://fontjoy.com/
I can pick out the perfect font combination based on my choice or exclusion of a particular font.

### Let's Enhance
https://letsenhance.io/
If a picture too small, and I need to resize it without losing quality.

## AI art generator:



## What I have learn 
- Choose the right generator, using the precise prompts or resources is the most important thing to generate things you want
- After the generation we Usually still need to use other tools to adjust it to suit the requirment including enhance solution tool, Photoshop to seperate image into several layers to suit different usage scenarios.
- 

## What I can do in the future and things need to be concerned:
- Now I slightly understand how AI art generator work, every generator is different. Following listed the difference between the most wellknown AI art generators:

| Attempt | #1    | #2    |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: |
| Seconds | 301   | 283   |
