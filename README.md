# CreativeMaking-LegendOfHanzi-UnitingThePastAndPresent

In this project, the primary objective was to explore the application of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the field of illustration. To accomplish this, I utilized a specific AI art generator called Dreamlike, utilizing its default model known as Kandinsky 2.1. By leveraging this tool, I was able to upload multiple images and generate a composite outcome that incorporates various elements such as color palette, texture, and composition.

For the main resources of this project, I deliberately selected two distinct images. The first image was characterized by its grayscale tonality and possessed a prominently thick brush stroke texture. The second image featured elements such as butterflies, bridges, cranes, and clouds, executed in a traditional Chinese drawing style.

The intention behind this assignment was to gain practical experience in utilizing AI technologies within the realm of illustration. Through the employment of Dreamlike's AI art generator and the careful selection of the aforementioned images, I sought to explore the interplay of various artistic features and styles, including color, texture, and composition.

## My Mission of the Project
- 4 backgrounds: Game Cover, Background of 2 game levels, game endings background
- GIF sequences of Hanzi translation animation

## What I would like to learn from this project
I worked as an illustrator before and is running my own brand. Usually one painting will take 3-5 working days, preprocesses including doing research, drawing draft, composition, create color schemes. After all these preparation then I can finally start drawing. I'm thinking in which step could be helped by AI so I started the research:

## AI helping in specific part of drawing
### Huemint:
https://huemint.com/upload/
Huemint is a colour palette generator. The app uses machine learning to create unique colour combinations for your brand, website, or graphics.
### Fontjoy:
https://fontjoy.com/
I can pick out the perfect font combination based on my choice or exclusion of a particular font.

### Let's Enhance
https://letsenhance.io/
If a picture too small, and I need to resize it without losing quality.

## AI art generator DREAMLIKE :
I choose to use dreamlike(https://dreamlike.art/create) as the main tool to help me generate image I want since it allows you to upload your own image by using the default Kandinsky2.1 model. Unlike Midjourney, DALL.E which using prompt to generate image, Dreamlike use image to communicate. Also I found Midjourney and DALL.E are better in create an image which has a main charactor but what I want is scene which have strong story telling ability.

I used my own work and also others work to test how's the outcome:

This model can not only extract colour, texture, composition from each image, it can also adjust weight from each image. I found it would have better outcome if at least one of the resource image has simple content since I want players know what my image wants to convey from their first sight.

## What I have learn 
- Choose the right generator, using the precise prompts or resources is the most important thing to generate things you want
- After the generation we Usually still need to use other tools to adjust it to suit the requirment including enhance solution tool, Photoshop to seperate image into several layers to suit different usage scenarios.
- 

## What I can do in the future and things need to be concerned:
- Now I slightly understand how AI art generator work, every generator is different. Following listed the difference between the most wellknown AI art generators:

| Attempt | #1    | #2    |
| :---:   | :---: | :---: |
| Seconds | 301   | 283   |
